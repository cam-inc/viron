title: Group
---

This function enables you to assemble endpoints to look beautifully organized on the dashboard.

It works like a directory; however, there are subtle differences:
- The relationship between endpoints and a group is built on `reference` rather than the `parent-child hierarchy`.
- Each group has its `priority`, affecting how groups are ordered on the dashboard.
