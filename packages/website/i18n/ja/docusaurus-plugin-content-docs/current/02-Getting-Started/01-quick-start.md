title: Quick Start

On this page, we will guide you to try out Viron and see how it works by using the demo-API server.

## Visiting the Dashboard
Access [https://viron.plus](https://viron.plus), the Viron home page, and click the `Dashboard` button to navigate to the dashboard page where you can add, edit and remove endpoints.

## Adding an Endpoint
On the dashboard page, click the `Add-an-Endpoint` button to open a modal UI to add a new endpoint. Then, input the URL of `https://demo.viron.plus` in the field for URL.

:::note
This endpoint is only a **demo-purpose** one, so you need to create your endpoint for the services you manage when you integrate Viron with your service workflow.
:::

Finally, input `demo` for the ID field and leave the group field blank, and click the `Create` button to finish this task. You will see the newly added demo endpoint on the dashboard page.

## Signing in the Endpoint
To sign in using Goggle OAuth, click the `OAuth` button on the endpoint item on the dashboard and click the `Submit` button.

:::note
A Google account is required.
:::

You will be navigated to `Google's authentication page` to select an account. Choose one to use to be redirected back to Viron. After being redirected, click the `Submit` button to confirm.

## Endpoint Page
Being authenticated successfully, you will be on the **demo endpoint page**, where you can play around editing the demo data.
